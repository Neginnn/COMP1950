				<h3>Introduction</h3>
				<p class="paragraph"> Team CodeMonkeys had 3 main goals for this project. The first is to create a user interface that is easy to learn, easy to navigate and with elements in places that you would expect (ie. the search bar in the upper right hand corner).  Our second goal is to take the problems experienced by the client and to create acceptable solutions.  Our last goal was to make sure that the website would be accessible through a touch tablet or mobile phone device.</p>

				<h3>Rationale</h3>
				<p class="paragraph">Team CodeMonkeys decided to go towards the path of the simple, but beautiful approach.</p>
				<p class="paragraph">On sites such as CNN.com, has bright distractive colours have become the norm.  The COMP1950 site requires no such distractions.  The visual style should focus mainly on the content, not on flashy colours that may distract the user.  Therefore, every element on the page must have a purpose and every colour should have meaning.</p>
				<p class="paragraph">With the introduction of new tablets and the use of mobile phones, the 9-10 inch screen sizes has become the most important size to target.  We decided that our site would be optimized for this screen size and for the use of touch mobile phones.</p>
				<p class="paragraph">The existing site uses a Navigation list docked to the right side of the page.  This is difficult to use with touch devices since the links are too close together and leaves the page unbalanced when you scroll down to where the links are no longer visible.  The new navigation is a tabbed bar at the top of the page with sufficient spacing to allow for easy access on touch devices.</p>
				<p class="paragraph">The tabbed links that contain a submenu will have a dropdown list of associated links.  This is to ensure that the site remains as uncluttered as possible.</p>
				<p class="paragraph">We also wanted to make it simple to view the site on an overhead projector. Therefore, we included a overhead stylesheet as an alternative style.</p>
				<p class="paragraph">Smartphone are also a very important part of this site and we include a mobile version which works with all major mobile operating systems.</p>
